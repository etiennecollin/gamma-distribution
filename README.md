# [The Gamma Distribution](https://github.com/etiennecollin/gamma-distribution/blob/main/LaTeX%20Document/The_gamma_distribution.pdf)

**This is a paper outlining the various properties and applications of the gamma distribution.**

This is your new Bible. After the Old Testament and the New Testament, we hereby present to you, the Gamma Testament. Thou shall follow Its Holy teachings and live by Its mathematical axioms. May you be enlightened by the fruit of our labour, dare I say, the modern Apple of Knowledge. You shall now open Pandora's box and unveil the truth for the seventh day hath cometh.

> "If the Gamma Distribution is all you have, You have all you need" - John 14:8
